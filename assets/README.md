# JavaScript: Password Generator

A Javascript app that generates a password based on user inputs.

## Usage
Click "Generate Password" button to walk through a series of prompts that will generate a password length of your choosing, using your choice of characters.

## Future Development
Interested in making this a mobile app, possibly? More for experimental purposes, rather than practical use, but maybe for both

## Deployed Application

See also https://github.com/thegetoutgirl/password-gen for previous commits. Canï¿½t seem to deploy, not sure why.
